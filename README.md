# NET3010---Web_Programming
In my Final Lab for my web programming course (NET 3010) at Algonquin College, I created a fake website to learn and practice web development. From front-end and back-end as well.

> :warning: **ACADEMIC WARNING**: Please note that if you attempt "to use and pass off my code and one's own idea or product of work without expressly giving credit to me and asking for my consent" is considered PLAGIARISM! Thank you.


Below is a video demo of the website, unfortunetly I cannot at this time host the website. If you'd like to see a live demo or have any questions please feel free to email be at: jawadskadri@gmail.com

Also below is a document showing the style formatting for my website, this was necassaary to create a guide I could follow when creating the front-end:
